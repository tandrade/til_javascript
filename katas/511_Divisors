Kata: Find the number of divisors of a positive integer n.

My solution: 
function getDivisorsCnt(n){
    var total = 0; 
    var divisor = n; 
    while (divisor > 0) { 
      if (n % divisor === 0) total += 1;
      divisor -= 1;
    } 
    return total;
}

Best solution:
function getDivisorsCnt(n) {
  for (var d = 0, i = n; i > 0; i--) {
    if (n % i == 0) d++;
  }
  
  return d;
}

Notes: 
- Code wars gave me an easier kata, but I think it's a little too easy: didn't learn much from this one 
- I still don't understand the difference between == and ===, I don't think this will be solved via kata, probably have to either build something more complicated or just read up more on the question 
- I did not know / think of declaring the value to return in the for loop: I can see the appeal (one less line of code!) but it seems slightly less readable 
- To test whether I really understood it, I did not use { } in the one line 'if' statement
