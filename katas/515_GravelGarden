Kata:
Help Suzuki rake his garden!

The monastery has a magnificent Zen garden made of white gravel and rocks and it is raked diligently everyday by the monks. Suzuki having a keen eye is always on the lookout for anything creeping into the garden that must be removed during the daily raking such as insects or moss.

You will be given a string representing the garden. Rake out any items that are not a rock or gravel and replace them with gravel such.

My solution:
function rakeGarden(garden) {
  var rakedGarden = [];
  var all_items = garden.split(" ");
  for (var i=0; i < all_items.length; i++) { 
     if (all_items[i] === "rock" || all_items[i] === "gravel") { 
       rakedGarden.push(all_items[i]); 
     }
     else { 
       rakedGarden.push("gravel");
     } 
  } 
  return rakedGarden.join(" ");
}


Best solution:
function rakeGarden(garden) { 

  var tab = garden.split(" ");
  for(var i=0; i<tab.length;i++){
    if(tab[i]!='rock' && tab[i]!='gravel'){
      tab[i] = 'gravel';
    }
  }
  var rakedGarden = tab.join(" ");

  return rakedGarden;
 }

Thoughts: 
- Learned some more list techniques! I keep thinking the equivalent of .append() is .add() in JS -- it's .push() 
- The 'best' solution is a lot more compact: I should have thought about ways to cut down on the code before I submitted
